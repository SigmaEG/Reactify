# Reactify
Similar to the Codify plugin except it only currently supports React-Lua since this is made for personal use but I decided to publish it for anyone else's use too.

Syntax highlighting matches based on your Roblox Studio's highlighting configuration.

Written using React-Lua.

Supports [React.Tag] by reading the Tags on an Instance.

The parser for the API Dump of Instance properties is written by me and is included in the Source Code in the Packages Folder under the title "Properties". The data collected is from a separate automated [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Client-Tracker/tree/roblox)
