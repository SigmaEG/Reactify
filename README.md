# Reactify
Similar to the Codify plugin except it only currently supports React-Lua since this is made for personal use but I decided to publish it for anyone else's use too.

Descendants of an Instance you select in Studio won't be included in the Generated Snippet, this feature has not been implemented as I don't exactly need a use for it at the moment.

Syntax highlighting matches based on your Roblox Studio's highlighting configuration.

Written using React-Lua.

The parser for the API Dump of Instance properties is written by me, however the data collected is from a separate automated [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Client-Tracker/tree/roblox)
